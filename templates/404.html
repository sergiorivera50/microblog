    <p>
        Unfortunately, the page you were looking for could not be found.
        However, here's something I can offer you to compensate for such an
        incredible disappointment:
    </p>
    <p>
        $$
        f(x_{1}, \dots, x_{n}) = \sum\limits_{q=0}^{2n}\Phi_{q} (\sum\limits_{p=1}^{n} \phi_{q,p}(x_{p}))
        $$
    </p>
    <p>
        If you know what this is, you might want to stick around and read my
        <a href="/blog">blog</a> ðŸ˜‰
    </p>
</div>
