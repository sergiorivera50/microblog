Hello! My name is <strong>Sergio</strong>, and I am a Machine Learning engineer operating at the intersection of data science and applied mathematics.

I hold an MPhil in Advanced Computer Science from the University of Cambridge, where I received supervision from [Prof Amanda Prorok](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/people/asp45). As of now, I work as a Data Scientist for a large consulting firm in Madrid.

Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sergioriveralopez/) and make sure to check out my [blog](/blog) âœ¨ where I post articles on Machine Learning & AI.
